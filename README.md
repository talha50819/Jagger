# Jagger Federation Registry

[Jagger](http://jagger.heanet.ie) is developed by HEAnet to manage the Edugate multiparty SAML federation. Other organisations use Jagger to manage their federations, but it can also be used to manage the web-of-trust for a single entity. Additionally, it can be used as a GUI for the Shibboleth SAML Identity Provider ([Shibboleth](https://www.shibboleth.net)).

> [!NOTE]
> **This is not the official installation guide.** HEAnet's official documentation
> (see [Documentation](#documentation)) targets older, EOL package and OS versions.
> [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) below targets current releases instead — Debian 13 /
> Ubuntu 24.04+, PHP 8.4/8.5, Let's Encrypt or a self-signed cert, `utf8mb4` —
> see [Requirements](#requirements) below for the full current baseline.

## Features

1. Synchronise SAML metadata from another federation.
2. Create and manage a federation.
3. Create a single circle of trust containing metadata of all entities that your organisation participates in via multiple federations.
4. GUI to manage the attribute policy of identity providers based on the Shibboleth SAML implementation.
5. Filter the `RequestedAttribute`s of a SAML service provider to allow an IdP to release attributes to such providers based on a policy set in the Jagger GUI.
6. Create and edit metadata of individual entities.
7. Notification subsystem with subscription options.

## Installation

Make sure you meet the [Requirements](#requirements) above before starting.

### Quick Start (Automated)

[`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh) installs and configures Jagger end-to-end on a fresh
Debian 13 / Ubuntu 24.04+ server. On the target server, as root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/talha50819/Jagger.git
cd Jagger
chmod +x deploy.sh
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

It auto-detects the server's IP/OS, asks you for the handful of values it
can't guess (FQDN, admin email, DB credentials — or press Enter to
auto-generate a strong password), then runs the full deployment with a
progress bar and per-step timing. It also asks whether this is a **testing**
deployment (default — a self-signed certificate, works with any hostname,
e.g. inside a VM) or a **production** one (a real Let's Encrypt certificate,
which needs a public domain that already resolves to this server).

> [!TIP]
> For a non-interactive/scripted run, pass `-y` and set the `JAGGER_*`
> environment variables described at the top of [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh)
> (e.g. `JAGGER_FQDN`, `JAGGER_ADMIN_EMAIL`).

Once it finishes, continue with [Setup Jagger Registry](#setup-jagger-registry)
below.

### Setup Jagger Registry

1. Navigate to: `https://<your-fqdn>/rr3/setup` (the FQDN you gave `deploy.sh`).
2. Create the initial Admin user.
3. **Crucial Security Step**: Edit `/opt/rr3/application/config/config_rr.php` and change:
   ```php
   $config['rr_setup_allowed'] = FALSE;
   ```

---

### Updating Jagger

> [!WARNING]
> **Always back up your code and database before performing an update.**

1. Pull the latest code from the Git repository:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/rr3
   git pull
   ```
2. Navigate to the application folder and update the database schema:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/rr3/application
   ./doctrine orm:schema-tool:update --force
   ./doctrine orm:generate-proxies
   ```
3. Sign in to the application and trigger the upgrade routine by visiting:
   `https://<your-fqdn>/rr3/update/upgrade`
4. Always compare your local `/opt/rr3/index.php` with CodeIgniter's default `index.php` and update the local one if necessary.
